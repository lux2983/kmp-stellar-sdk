# SEP Implementations

The SDK provides support for Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) to enable interoperability with the Stellar ecosystem.

## What are SEPs?

Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) are standards that define how services, applications, and organizations interact with the Stellar network. They ensure consistent implementation of common patterns like domain verification, authentication, and asset anchoring.

## Implemented SEPs

| SEP | Title | Documentation |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| SEP-1 | Stellar TOML | [sep-01.md](sep-01.md) |
| SEP-9 | Standard KYC Fields | [sep-09.md](sep-09.md) |
| SEP-10 | Web Authentication | [sep-10.md](sep-10.md) |
| SEP-12 | KYC API | [sep-12.md](sep-12.md) |

## Future SEP Implementations

Additional SEP implementations will be documented here as they are added to the SDK.

**Planned SEPs**:
- SEP-24: Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal
- SEP-38: Anchor RFQ API
- And more...
